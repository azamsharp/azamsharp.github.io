                "name": "Thrips",
                "description": "Thrips are tiny, slender insects that feed on plant tissues by piercing plant cells and sucking out the contents. They infest a wide variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and flowers. Thrips are not only harmful because of their feeding, but they can also transmit plant viruses.",
                "symptoms": "Plants affected by thrips may show silvery or stippled discoloration on leaves, distorted or deformed growth, and dark specks (fecal spots) on the leaves. In severe cases, flowers and fruits may become deformed or prematurely drop, and the plant may show signs of stunted growth.",
                "treatment": "To control thrips, introduce natural predators such as lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and predatory mites. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and reduce thrips populations. Insecticidal soap, neem oil, or horticultural oils can be used for organic control. Regularly inspect plants and remove heavily infested leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of thrips.",
