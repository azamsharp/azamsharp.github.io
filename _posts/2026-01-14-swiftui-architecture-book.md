# The SwiftUI Architecture Book Is Finally Here

After more than three years of building apps, teaching SwiftUI, experimenting with different ideas, and sometimes getting things wrong, I am excited to finally share that my book [**SwiftUI Architecture - Patterns and Practices for Building Scalable Applications**](https://azamsharp.school/swiftui-architecture-book.html) is officially available.

This book has been a long time coming.

SwiftUI feels simple when you first start using it. The views read nicely. The code feels approachable. Then your app grows and things start to feel heavier. State shows up in unexpected places. Logic slowly spreads. You find yourself asking questions like

- Why does this feel harder than it should?
- Where should this logic live?
- Do I actually need this extra layer?

Those questions are exactly why I decided to write this book.

## Why I Wrote This Book

I have been working with SwiftUI since 2019. I have used it in real production apps, taught it in workshops, and worked through the same problems alongside my students.

Over time, I noticed a pattern. Most of the frustration did not come from SwiftUI itself. It came from trying to apply architectural ideas that made sense in older UI frameworks but did not fit the way SwiftUI actually works.

This book is my attempt to slow things down and rethink architecture from the ground up, through the lens of SwiftUI.

## What This Book Is About

This is a practical book. It is not about chasing trends or promoting a single architecture. It is about learning how to make better decisions as your app grows.

Inside the book, we talk about

- Where state truly belongs
- How to avoid adding layers too early
- When abstractions help and when they get in the way
- How to keep views simple without making everything global
- How to build systems that are easier to understand months later

Every chapter is based on real experience. These are lessons learned from building, refactoring, and maintaining SwiftUI apps over time.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for developers who already know SwiftUI but feel unsure once their app moves beyond simple examples.

If you have ever felt that your codebase became more complicated even though you were trying to do the right thing, you are not alone. I have been there many times myself.

The goal of this book is to help you feel more confident in your architectural choices, not by giving you rigid rules, but by helping you understand tradeoffs.

## A Living Book

The initial release includes 10 chapters, with more planned for the future.

When you purchase the book, you will receive all future updates at no additional cost.

## Thank You

I am deeply thankful to everyone who supported this journey. Through conversations, feedback, workshops, courses, and encouragement, you helped shape this book more than you may realize.

If SwiftUI is part of your daily work, I hope this book helps you build with more clarity, more confidence, and less frustration.
