# Container Pattern in SwiftUI 

Container pattern is a common pattern used in React community. Since React and SwiftUI are quite similar, this pattern can also be used for building SwiftUI applications. 


>> I personally prefer [MV Pattern](https://azamsharp.com/2022/10/06/practical-mv-pattern-crud.html) instead of the Container Pattern, but depending on your requirements you may find Container Pattern easy and simple to use. 

## What is Container Pattern? 

The main idea behind container pattern revolves around two different kind of views namely container and presentation views. The container view is responsible for fetching the data, sorting, filtering and other operations and then passing it down to presentation view for display.
