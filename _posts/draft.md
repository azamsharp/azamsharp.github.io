# Art of Speaking at Developer Conferences 

I presented my first speaking engagement back in 2004-2005 at the computer science club of my university. It was attended by a single student. My next presentation was in front of 120 people at Microsoft.NET User Group meeting. After that I spoke at dozens of user groups & conferences. In this post, I will all the lessons I learned during my decade+ experience in speaking. 

>> I strongly believe that it is easier to present in front of a larger audience as compared to a smaller one. For smaller audience you have to fight to to hide your disappointment. 

## User groups? 

Before you start speaking at large conferences, it will be a good idea to get comfortable in your presentation skills. Find out local user groups in your area and volunteer to speak at them. This will give you an opportunity to test your speaking skills in front of a smaller audience and work our your presentation. 

A lot of famous comedians follow the same technique. Instead of directly speaking at the Madison Square Garden, they first test their jokes in front of smaller audience. This give them an idea on how to structure their jokes and where to put the emphasis. 

>> A growing number of meetups are moved online only. This gives you an opportunity to apply and speak at user group meetings located outside your city. 

Programming meetups are always looking for volunteers. And now with remote speaking opportunities, the possibilities are endless. Your next step is to find local or remote meetups in your area and start speaking. 

## How to select a topic for speaking? 

I have been been guilty of selecting and even speaking on topics that I was not passionate about. The main issue with going after a shinny topic is that the audience will always be able to tell that you are lacking passion for something you are talking about. You can try to hide all you want, but your body language, voice and your xxx will. 

## Interacting with the community  

When you are attending a conference as a speaker, then you should only be attending the conference as a speaker. I see a lot of speakers head down on their laptops instead of interacting with the audience.

>> I can understand that some people may have trouble interacting with complete strangers. But you have to start somewhere. Let go of your fears and make some new friends.  

One of the best ways to interact with other developers is during lunch or dinner. Conference attendees usually go out to eat in small groups. I always randomly selected a group enjoyed their company. During the lunch/dinner, I would get to know my group members. I would find out their role in their company and what technologies excites them. 

Make sure your interest is genuine and does not have some sort of an plan behind it.  


## Last second 

If you are speaker at a conference then don't talk about that you prepared the presentation at the last second and you were up all night preparing slides. Keep in mind that attendees pay a lot of money for the conference tickets and they don't want to hear that the speaker is not prepared. It also shows that you have bad time management skills and waited for the last minute to prepare for the session. 

>> Once I know that I am speaking at a conference, I spend months preparing for the session. My preparing includes slides, live coding rehearsals, recording demo videos for backup and much more. 

I usually see this kind of behavior from experienced speakers, who wants to convey the message that even with little preparation they will give a great presentation. I am sure they will give an excellent presentation but they don't need to announce their lack of time management skills to the audience. 

>> This is like, if I attend high profile UFC fight and the fighter tells everyone that he started preparing for the fight just yesterday.
