# Vibe Coding Is Killing Your Critical Thinking Skills 

A long time ago, when I was commuting back from a client’s office, I used to call a friend almost every day to keep me company during the long drive. For the entire hour, we would talk about nothing in particular, just aimless chatter, until I arrived at my destination.

If you asked me what I saw during that hour-long commute, I couldn’t tell you a single thing. Not the road, not the traffic, not even the turns I took.

I feel the same way with Vibe Coding. I get pulled into a flow where I am chasing momentum, not clarity. I might end up with something that works, but I do not really understand how I got there — or worse, how to explain it or maintain it later. Just like that commute, it feels productive in the moment, but looking back, it is all a blur.
