# Active Record Pattern for Building SwiftUI Apps with Core Data  

Lately, I have been talking a lot about different architectural patterns that can be used to build SwiftUI applications. I discussed [MV pattern](https://azamsharp.com/2022/10/06/practical-mv-pattern-crud.html) for building client/server applications and [Container pattern](https://azamsharp.com/2023/01/24/introduction-to-container-pattern.html), when testing is not high priority.  

Recently, I have been building Core Data applications and I wanted to try out Active Record Pattern and see how it feels. In this post, I will cover my experience with building SwiftUI apps using Active Record Pattern.

## What is Active Record Pattern? 

The Active Record pattern is a design pattern used in software development for connecting a database to an object-oriented programming language. It is a pattern in which an object that represents a database table or view is essentially a direct mapping to a single row of the table or view. Active Record objects typically have methods for retrieving and manipulating the data stored in the database, and they can also include validation logic for enforcing business rules on the data. The Active Record pattern is often used in web application development frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and Laravel.

## Why Active Record Pattern?

Active Record Pattern is ideal for building apps that exibit.
