# Art of Speaking at Developer Conferences 

I presented my first speaking engagement back in 2004-2005 at the computer science club of my university. It was attended by a single student. My next presentation was in front of 120 people at Microsoft.NET User Group meeting. After that I spoke at dozens of user groups & conferences. In this post, I will all the lessons I learned during my decade+ experience in speaking. 

>> I strongly believe that it is easier to present in front of a larger audience as compared to a smaller one. For smaller audience you have to fight to to hide your disappointment. 

## User groups? 

Before you start speaking at large conferences, it will be a good idea to get comfortable in your presentation skills. Find out local user groups in your area and volunteer to speak at them. This will give you an opportunity to test your speaking skills in front of a smaller audience and work our your presentation. 

A lot of famous comedians follow the same technique. Instead of directly speaking at the Madison Square Garden, they first test their jokes in front of smaller audience. This give them an idea on how to structure their jokes and where to put the emphasis. 

>> A growing number of meetups are moved online only. This gives you an opportunity to apply and speak at user group meetings located outside your city. 

Programming meetups are always looking for volunteers. And now with remote speaking opportunities, the possibilities are endless. Your next step is to find local or remote meetups in your area and start speaking.

CHANGE THIS 
One of the things I really find upsetting at conferences is when I see the speaker not engaging with the audience. I remember attending a conference few years back, where the speaker sat quietly in the corner and worked on his computer. After the presentation was over, the speaker stood up and left. It was like he has seen a bat signal and wanted to flee the current situation. 


## Last second 

If you are speaker at a conference then don't talk about that you prepared the presentation at the last second and you were up all night preparing slides. Keep in mind that attendees pay a lot of money for the conference tickets and they don't want to hear that the speaker is not prepared. It also shows that you have bad time management skills and waited for the last minute to prepare for the session. 

>> Once I know that I am speaking at a conference, I spend months preparing for the session. My preparing includes slides, live coding rehearsals, recording demo videos for backup and much more. 

I usually see this kind of behavior from experienced speakers, who wants to convey the message that even with little preparation they will give a great presentation. I am sure they will give an excellent presentation but they don't need to announce their lack of time management skills to the audience. 

>> This is like, if I attend high profile UFC fight and the fighter tells everyone that he started preparing for the fight just yesterday.
