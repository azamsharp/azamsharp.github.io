# Becoming an iOS Developer - The Complete Guide 2023 

TODO 

>> A lot of content covered in this article is part of my book called [Surviving the Coding Bootcamp - From no coding experience to earning a six-figure salary](https://azamsharp.gumroad.com/l/surviving-the-coding-bootcamp). 

## Do I need a computer science degree? 

The short answer is NO! You do not need a degree to become a software developer. As a coding bootcamp instructor for the last 5+ years, I have taught to many students who did not have a degree and they turned out to be amazing developers. 

Having said that if you do have an option to attend school, debt free then go ahead and get a degree. I just don't want anyone to rake up $100K debt, thinking that it was the only way to become a software developer. 

If you decide against getting a degree then keep in mind that there will be few jobs that may require a degree. Usually, these jobs are with big non-technology and education companies. This includes oil/gas/energy giants and even schools and colleges. 

People often ask me that how much of knowledge I learned in school is being used in my day to day job. For me personally, I use 0.000000000000001% of information I learned in school at my actual work. Most of the things I use at work, I learned on my own. This included Microsoft.NET, C# language, VB.NET and ASP.NET (back in 2003).  

## What about Coding Bootcamps? 

Coding bootcamps are a great way to learn a particular stack quickly. Instead of spending 4 years and $100K in college, you spend 4 months and $15K-$20K. Coding bootcamps are fast paced and as a a student, you need to digest the information on daily basis. This format may not suit everyone and once a student gets too behind in their assignments, homework etc it becomes almost impossible to recover from it. 

Once again, I am not advocating taking out loans to attend a coding bootcamp. Work hard and save $15K-$20K and then attend a bootcamp, completely debt free. 

Keep in mind that a coding bootcamp is not some magical place, where you can sit back and relax and become a developer in 4 months. This is like saying that I need to loose weight so I got a gym membership but never attended gym. Just because you are paying for a gym membership will not help you loose weight. You need to actually put in the work and burn those calories.     

>> Disclaimer: I work for coding bootcamp. 

## What about free online resources? 

Programming is one of those rare professions where you don't really need a degree to land a job. There are countless free resources available online. This ranges from YouTube videos, books, articles, courses and even free lectures from elite universities like Stanford. 

## Learning Swift Language 

Let me tell you the biggest secret in software development. Programming languages are easy to learn. Once you know one language, you can easily learn any other language. In our bootcamp we start with Python language. Once students are comfortable with the fundamentals, we jump to the JavaScript language. We typically spend only one day in learning JavaScript, because students already know Python language. 

## SwiftUI or UIKit 

One of the roadblocks, new developers face is to choose between UIKit vs SwiftUI. This is an interesting question because there is no one correct answer. My recommendation is that spend 75% of your time learning SwiftUI and 25% on UIKit. SwiftUI is the future and all new development is being done in SwiftUI. 

Having said that, as a new developer you will likely not be working on a green field project. This means you will be dealing with legacy code, which is probably written in UIKit. This is where your 25% is going to come in handy.   

>> Greenfield projects are the one that lack the constraints imposed by prior work. A brownfield project is one that carries constraints related to the current state of the site. 

One thing I noticed about new developers is that they want to see the progress quickly. I don't blame them, if I am starting to learn something new then I would like to see the results quickly too. SwiftUI declarative syntax, along with Xcode previews allows developers to quickly prototype their apps.    

## Programming is not an open heart surgery

Even though I have been teaching at coding bootcamp for a very long time, one thing I witness in each cohort is student’s fear of writing wrong code. Students would rather jump off a building than write wrong code. I think this is deeply rooted to our education system, where different and unique answers are punished instead of being appreciated. 

In one of the TED talks, Sir Ken Robinson talked about a young girl who was considered hopeless by her teachers. The teachers contacted her parents and told them that they believe that the child has learning disability and she is not able to concentrate in class. 

Her parents took her to see a specialist. The specialist discussed talked to the parents about their child’s condition. After a while, the doctor left the room with the parents leaving the kid alone. As they left the room, the specialist turned on the radio. 

To everyone’s surprise, the little girl started dancing to the music. The doctor turned to her parents and told them that the girl is not sick, she is a dancer and you should take her to dance school and they did. 

That little girl was Gillian Lynne, legendary English ballerina, dancer and choreographer. She is responsible for some of the most successful theater productions in history and she is a multi-millionaire.

Like Gillian Lynne, we all have creative genes in our body. Unfortunately, this creativity starts to fade away as we enter schools and colleges. Students are punished for having creative thoughts and are told to follow the yellow brick road. Colleges focuses solely on how students can get good grades instead of a good education.

I always tell my students that writing code is not like an open heart surgery. If you make a mistake, nobody will die. The worst that can happen is your editor is going to give syntax errors, presented as a learning opportunity.

Nobody writes perfect code first time. Everyone makes mistakes. The most important thing is that you learn from your mistakes and improve yourself to become a better developer.   

>> If you are afraid to be wrong, you will never come up with anything original - Sir Ken Robinson

Curiosity also plays an important role in becoming a good developer. Instead of following a predefined path, try to experiment what will happen if you change few lines of code or if you adjust the ordering of the lines. Don’t get discouraged if the path you choose hits a brick wall. You didn’t fail in solving the problem, you just learned several other ways your program does not work.

As a new developer your main goal is to get the program working. It does not have to be the best and the most efficient code, it just have to work correctly. After you get it working then you can make it better through the process of refactoring. 

Refactoring is a principle of changing existing code to make it better without changing the overall functionality of the code. 

## Micro tasks

The year was 2004 and I was taking a .NET web services class at University of Houston. My assignment was due in few hours and I was stuck. I just could not comprehend the scope of the assignment. Each time I begin implementing the solution, I got overwhelmed. I felt like standing in front of a huge mountain. Mountain so high that I cannot even see the peak. 

  I decided to take a break from coding. I knew that my method was not working and I need to try something different. I took out my notepad and wrote down all the steps I needed to take in order to complete the assignment. After that I focused on one single step at a time. Every time I complete a step, I crossed it out. Soon I was able to complete all the steps, which in turn completed the assignment.

The lesson that I learned from this experience is that one of the most important skills you can learn as a software developer is to break down a large task into micro tasks. Micro tasks represent a very small subset of a larger task. Once you finish all the micro tasks associated with a particular task, your primary task is completed. This technique allows you to move much quicker since you are focusing on a single problem.   

New developers usually look at a programming problem and get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of it. Try to break it down into smaller manageable pieces and then only focus on the smaller piece. 

Dividing a large task into micro tasks is a skill that you will develop as you gain more experience. My advice is to always write down your tasks on a piece of paper (Remember paper, that comes from trees) and then check them off as you finish them. This will visually show you which tasks are completed and more importantly it will give you the confidence to move forward and attempt other tasks in the list. 

A task can be as simple as displaying few text boxes on the screen or even changing the background color of the screen. The main idea is to break down to a granular level that you are comfortable with and are able to complete it in a short amount of time. 

Another question my students ask is that should they attempt the easier task first or hard. My recommendation is to always start with an easier task first. The reason is that once you finish the easier task, it will give you the confidence to tackle hard tasks. If you attempt the hard task first and get stuck then even the easier tasks will feel challenging. The confidence you gain from completing easy tasks will provide you the momentum to face and conquer hard tasks. 

Next time you are about to write an app, write down all the tasks associated with your app. Then take each task and divide it further into micro tasks. Now you can start with each micro task and only focus on that one micro task. You will notice that using this approach you are going to complete tasks much faster and it will provide you the encouragement you need to move forward. 

## Google and StackOverFlow 

One of the main aspects of a coding bootcamp is to teach students to be independent. As a student you should take advantage of your instructor’s knowledge but at the same time you should work towards becoming independent.   

Information is now readily available at your finger tips. Every coding question you have has already been answered and just waiting to be discovered. You no longer have to drive to a local library and search through magazines and books for a solution. You can simply go to Google and type in your question and voila!   

Apart from searching for your answer on a search engine, you should also be comfortable with asking for help. There is nothing wrong with asking for help when you need it. There are several different forums where you can post your programming questions.  

    I remember taking part on ASP.NET forums, while I was still in college. At that time I was learning web development so I posted a lot of questions on the forum. Later on, after I gained more experience I started helping people out. My contributions were recognized and I was awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award in 2007. 

Google also has similar programs (GDE), which are awarded based on developer’s contributions to the community. If you are awarded MVP or GDE then it will certainly look good on your resume. 

When asking questions on forums make sure to formalize it correctly. Don’t just paste 200 lines of code and ask why it does not work. Questions like that are regularly downvoted on online forums and if you continue posting such questions without any context then there is a probability that your account will be suspended. 

You need to explain the exact problem you are facing and what solutions you have tried. The more context you are going to provide, more experienced developers will be willing to help you. 

StackOverFlow has prepared a document, which illustrates how to ask a good question. You can read that document here (https://bit.ly/3MJAVVE).  

## Debugging 

According to Google, Debugging is defined as a process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. 

As a student, you should pay special attention to debugging, as majority of your time at work will be spent maintaining and fixing bugs in an existing legacy codebase.

In one of my earlier cohorts, I was teaching debugging in web development using Chrome developer tools. I strongly suggested all my students to pay close attention to the debugging techniques discussed in the class. Some did and others did not. Few months after graduation, one of my students from the same cohort came back to thank me for teaching debugging. He told me that debugging skills that he learned in class helped him fix a lot of bugs and allowing him to solve complicated problems at his new job.

 It does not matter what programming language or platform you are working with, all of them provides debugging features. Debugging might feels boring and it might even feel like a slow process but when applied correctly, you can detect bugs much quickly as compared to good old console logs. 

My simple rule is to locate the problem or bug using logs for the first 5 minutes. If I am not able to find the source of bugs then I resort to debugging.

## Pet Projects 

One of the best ways to boost your learning during a coding bootcamp is to work on your side/pet project. This project is not meant to be associated with the coding bootcamp graduation requirements. The main purpose of your personal project is to integrate all the skills you have learned during the coding bootcamp into your own application. 

This means your side project should be something that you are passionate about. Your passion will drive the progress of the project. One of my students from an earlier cohort had passion for astronomy. He used the concepts discussed in class to implement a custom iOS application to keep track of Earth’s distance from various sources. During the class, when we learned about how to consume a JSON API, he immediately went to NASA’s website and found a relevant API for his needs. Using the concepts that he learned in class, he was able to integrate the API into his own iOS app. 

It is always encouraging to see your project growing as you learn new skills. It also makes you confident that the knowledge you have learned during the coding bootcamp is practical and can be used to create real world applications. 

So go ahead and start your passion project on the side. When you acquire new knowledge through bootcamp learnings, apply it to your project. It is a great feeling when you can see your project growing right in front of your eyes. 

Once the project is mature enough you can include it in your resume. Employers are always interested in project based work from potential employees. You never know, the difference between you and other candidate might come down to your pet project. 

## Newsletters 

A million years ago, people used Google Reader to subscribe to RSS feeds and read their favorite blogs. I was one of those people and loved reading my subscriptions in the morning, with a hot cup of coffee. Good Reader was later killed by Google and ended up in the Google graveyard.

Please have a moment of silence for respect…

Nowadays, even though you can curate your own feeds. Most people rely on newsletters to stay updated. I love newsletters and I have subscribed to several of them. The main idea behind newsletter is that someone else is in charge of curating weekly articles/videos on a particular topic. As a subscriber to the newsletter, you only need to provide your email address and that’s it.

Once a week, on a designated day you will receive a list of curated content through your email. All you need to do is open the email and go through the articles that interest you. Most newsletters take liberty to write an abstract for the article. This will give you a much better idea about the article contents and if you will be interested in reading it further.

No matter what technology stack you are using to build an application, you can always find a newsletter pertaining to your needs. I have personally subscribed to newsletters ranging from machine learning, React, iOS development and even Flutter. I highly encourage you to subscribe to a few newsletters to get started, you will be amazed at how easy it is to keep up with all the latest happenings in the industry.  

Make sure you allocate weekly time to go through your newsletters. I go through my feeds during early morning on the weekends. By checking my newsletters on a weekend, I get the advantage of having all the updated feeds, since most newsletters are sent during the weekdays.

Searching for newsletters is quite simple too. Simply go to Google and search for your favorite topic i.e “React Newsletter”. You will be presented with several different options. Subscribe to the ones you find interesting and then sit back and enjoy with a hot cup of coffee. 


## Portfolio 

Nothing demonstrates your work better than a portfolio. Portfolio allows you to showcase your skills to an employer and make an immediate and a long lasting impression. I always advice my students to feature their main projects on their portfolio. 

Although you can invest your time in implementing the portfolio website yourself but my recommendation is to use a low cost template as a starting point of your portfolio. You can easily purchase a very good portfolio template from ThemeForest or similar websites for under $15. When purchasing a template, make sure to select a basic HTML, CSS template. This will allow you to easily change the contents of the template and publish it on all available hosting providers.

After completing the portfolio your next step is to deploy it and make it available to the rest of the world. A static website can be deployed to many different hosting providers including Surge, Netlify, GitHub Pages and infinite others. Apart from hosting, you should also invest in getting a custom domain name. Once again there are several different options. I recommend hover.com as they provide excellent customer service and don’t upsell you on additional features. 

Make sure to keep your portfolio up to date. As soon as you finish a project, add it to your portfolio. Don’t wait months or years to update your portfolio. It will take double the time if you wait, do it while it is fresh in your memory.

## GitHub Profile 

If there is such a thing as a resume strictly for developers then it would be your GitHub profile. GitHub profile hosts all your coding projects and allows prospective employers to evaluate your technical skills. 

A great GitHub project profile explains the purpose of the project clearly. It also list all the different technologies and APIs that were used in the project including live link and tags. If the project was UI/UX based then it should also include screenshots of the website. If it is a framework then it should consists of documentation on how to use the framework and even code samples. If your project is based on effects and animation, then it would be wise to add a small video or even a GIF animation showing the effect in action. This way viewers can simply watch the video and get a better understanding of your animation library, without spending time to download and install the framework.      

During bootcamp you may be submitting your assignments through GitHub. This means your GitHub will get populated with lots of different repositories. You can avoid repository overcrowding by pinning your most important projects, this will make sure that only your pinned projects appear on your GitHub home screen.  

Polishing your GitHub repository is mandatory in development world. If your repository does not even have a decent README file then it will send message to your audience that you don’t care much about your work.

Another things to keep in mind is not to publish your API keys or sensitive data in your GitHub repositories. Provided that your repositories are listed as public repositories, anyone can see and use your keys. Always make sure that your sensitive data is encrypted and not published online. 

GitHub is your developer resume. You must take time to make it stand out. It is not surprising that most students in my class who landed job first, had a polished GitHub profile. One of those students was Beyza Kilickol and her GitHub profile can be found here (https://github.com/beyzakilickol). As you can see Beyza worked extremely hard on her profile and made it easy for employers to experience her projects. She even added screenshots, videos, guest account login to streamline the experience. I encourage you to follow her GitHub profile as a template and learn how she has laid out her repositories.  

As developers we are always focused on coding and find these tasks meaningless. But in reality, they are very important and can be the difference between you getting the job or not.
