# Becoming an iOS Developer - The Complete Guide 2023

## Do I need a degree? 

The short answer is NO! You do not need a degree to become a software developer. As a coding bootcamp instructor for the last 5+ years, I have taught to many students who did not have a degree and they turned out to be amazing developers. 

Having said that if you do have an option to attend school, debt free then go ahead and get a degree. I just don't want anyone to rake up $100K debt, thinking that it was the only way to become a software developer. 

If you decide against getting a degree then keep in mind that there will be few jobs that may require a degree. Usually, these jobs are with big non-technology and education companies. This includes oil/gas/energy giants and even schools and colleges. 

People often ask me that how much of knowledge I learned in school is being used in my day to day job. For me personally, I use 0.000000000000001% of information I learned in school at my actual work. Most of the things I use at work, I learned on my own. This included Microsoft.NET, C# language, VB.NET and ASP.NET (back in 2003).  

## What about Coding Bootcamps? 

Coding bootcamps are a great way to learn a particular stack quickly. Instead of spending 4 years and $100K in college, you spend 4 months and $15K-$20K. Coding bootcamps are fast paced and as a a student, you need to digest the information on daily basis. This format may not suit everyone and once a student gets too behind in their assignments, homework etc it becomes almost impossible to recover from it. 

Once again, I am not advocating taking out loans to attend a coding bootcamp. Work hard and save $15K-$20K and then attend a bootcamp, completely debt free. 

Keep in mind that a coding bootcamp is not some magical place, where you can sit back and relax and become a developer in 4 months. This is like saying that I need to loose weight so I got a gym membership but never attended gym. Just because you are paying for a gym membership will not help you loose weight. You need to actually put in the work and burn those calories.
