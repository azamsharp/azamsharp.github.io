# Introduction to Microservices  

Microservices allow you to break down your application into smaller pieces. Each piece, known as a microservice is responsible for handling a particular aspect of your application. In this article, you are going to learn about the concepts of microservices.  

## Monolith vs Microservices  

Monolith applications are self-contained applications. This means that all the layers of the apps, including user interface, domain and data access are combined into a single program. 

Microservices architecture allows the application to be divided into smaller services. Each service will perform a certain task of the application. This means you can have microservices for authentication, fetching ratings, movie details etc. Microservice acts as an independent entity, which means they can be deployed independent of the rest of the system/services. 

Since, microservices are independent it does not matter what technologies you use to implement a microservice. This provides tremendous flexibility for developers to use the best tools for the job. One service can be using NodeJS with a PostgreSQL backend, while other can be using Vapor with GraphQL and MongoDB database. The communication medium for all the microservices is REST protocol.
