      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We <strong>do not sell</strong> your data. We do <strong>not</strong> show ads or use third‑party advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li>Your gardens, notes, and photos are stored on your device and can sync privately with <strong>Apple iCloud</strong> if enabled.</li>
        <li>Purchases are processed by <strong>Apple</strong> via <em>In‑App Purchase</em> (StoreKit). We never see or store your payment information.</li>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>My Veggie Garden is designed to collect only the minimum information necessary to operate the app:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Content</strong> (stored locally / iCloud): your gardens, planted vegetables, notes, and optional photo notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>: Apple may provide an anonymized transaction identifier for purchases. We do not collect device identifiers for tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (optional): Crash logs and performance data may be provided by Apple if you have shared analytics with app developers in iOS settings. We do not access raw device logs ourselves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We <em>do not</em> collect contact information (such as name or email) within the app, precise location, health data, or browsing history.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide core features like harvest countdowns, reminders, and photo notes.</li>
        <li>To sync your data across devices via iCloud if you enable iCloud on your Apple ID.</li>
        <li>To process subscriptions and purchases via Apple’s In‑App Purchase.</li>
        <li>To maintain and improve the app’s reliability (e.g., aggregated crash diagnostics from Apple).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage & Sync (iCloud)</h2>
      <p>If you enable iCloud, your data is stored in your private iCloud account under your Apple ID. Apple acts as a service provider for storage and sync. We do not have direct access to your iCloud account or credentials.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Payments (StoreKit)</h2>
      <p>Purchases and subscriptions are handled by Apple. We do not receive or store your full payment details. Apple may provide us with non‑sensitive purchase status information (e.g., active subscription) to unlock features on your devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising. Limited sharing occurs only to provide the app’s functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple</strong> (iCloud, StoreKit): storage/sync and payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash diagnostics</strong>: aggregated crash reports via Apple if you opt in at the OS level.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Your content remains on your device and, if enabled, in your iCloud account until you delete it. We do not maintain separate server copies. Purchase records are retained by Apple per their policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access & Edit</strong>: You can view and edit your gardens, notes, and photos directly in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong>: You can delete any item in the app. You may also delete the app or disable iCloud to remove synced data from iCloud (subject to Apple’s iCloud deletion policies).</li>
        <li><strong>Opt‑Out of Analytics</strong>: You can disable “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics” and “Share With App Developers” in iOS settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable or disable reminders in iOS Settings &gt; Notifications.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>My Veggie Garden is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use platform security features such as on‑device storage, transport encryption (HTTPS), and iCloud’s built‑in protections. No method is 100% secure, but we work to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International Users</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored on your device and/or Apple iCloud. Storage locations and processing are subject to Apple’s infrastructure and the laws of applicable jurisdictions.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. Material changes will be noted by updating the <em>Effective date</em> above. Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
