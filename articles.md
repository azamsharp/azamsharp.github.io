### [The Complete Guide to Async/Await in iOS 15 and Swift 5.5](async-await.md)

Asynchronous programming is a common requirement of any iOS application. The ability to perform task on a separate thread and not disturbing or blocking the user interface is always considered a good practice. In iOS 15 and Swift 5.5 Apple introduced async/await feature, which allows developers to easily implement asynchronous tasks with increased clarity and less lines of code. 

In this article, we are going to take a look at how you can use async/await, continuation and actors in your iOS application. 

### [Customizing Buttons in SwiftUI iOS 15](buttons-ios15.md) 

Buttons are an important part of any iOS application and in iOS 15, SwiftUI introduces several different ways to implement and customize buttons views. In this article we are going to learn about all the new ways you can customize your buttons.

### [Stocks App Using Async/Await, Pull To Refresh and Continuation in SwiftUI for iOS 15](stocks-app.md) 

Apple introduced tons of new features in Swift and SwiftUI. This includes Async/Await, Pull to Refresh, Continuation, Text Formatters etc. In this article, we are going to combine all the features together and build a stocks application.

### [Understanding AsyncImage in SwiftUI](async-image.md) 

At WWDC 2021, Apple unveiled tons of new SwiftUI features that will allow developers to create iOS apps even more fluently. One of the most anticipated features is the ability to display images using the Image view. In previous versions of SwiftUI, this was not possible and had to be implemented using custom code.
In iOS 15 and Xcode 13, Apple introduced AsyncImage, which allows you to download an image using just the URL. In this article, we will look at how to use AsyncImage in our SwiftUI applications.

### [Decoupling SwiftUI Views for Reusability](decouple-swiftui-views) 

When designing SwiftUI applications it is extremely important to make sure that the views are decoupled and reusable. Tightly coupled views are harder to maintain, reuse and can result in future complications.
In this post, I will demonstrate how to implement decoupled views that can be reused in SwiftUI applications.


### [Asynchronous Requests Using SwiftUI and Redux Middlewares](async-request-redux-swift) 

In the [last post](redux-swiftui), we discussed how to implement Redux design pattern in SwiftUI application. One of the most common operations in an iOS app is to perform asynchronous requests and display the result on the user interface. 

In Redux architecture, middleware are used to fetch data from an API and later dispatch an action updating the store. In this post, you will learn how to implement the middleware flow in Redux.

### [Surviving a Coding Bootcamp](surviving-coding-bootcamp) 

After training 100s of developers at multiple bootcamps, I believe it is my responsibility to share my learnings on what makes an excellent student and what steps you can take to survive and thrive in an intensive software development bootcamp.

### [Global State Management for SwiftUI Apps Using Redux (Introduction)](redux-swiftui)

State management is an essential part of any SwiftUI application. SwiftUI provides several built-in ways for managing state, which includes @State, @EnvironmentObject, @Binding and @StateObject.

@EnvironmentObject does manage global state, but it does not provide any structure. In this post, you will learn how to use Redux to organize the flow of your global state.

### [ViewModel Patterns](viewmodel-patterns)
MVVM Design Pattern allows us to write clean, modular apps where each screen can be controlled by one parent ViewModel. In this post, I will go over several common ViewModel patterns when implementing apps using MVVM pattern.

### [Core Data with SwiftUI Part 1](core-data-swift-ui-part-1)

In this post, you will learn how to integrate Core Data with your SwiftUI application using MVVM Design Pattern. You will also learn how to decouple your views with models by creating an abstraction for Core Data.
